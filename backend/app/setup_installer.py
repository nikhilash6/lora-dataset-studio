"""Setup installer: run whitelisted, self-contained installs in a background
thread and expose their live state for polling. Actions:

  ml_extras          -> face scoring and masks in LDS's managed quality Python
  face_scoring       -> verify and install the selected face-scoring packages
  masks              -> verify and install the selected person-mask packages
  watermark_inpaint  -> verify and install in LDS's isolated watermark Python
  ollama_model       -> stream Ollama's /api/pull for the configured vision model
  klein_model        -> download the Klein 9B (KV) fp8 diffusion model into
                        <ComfyUI>/models/unet/klein/ — a PUBLIC download (no token). The KV
                        build caches the reference images' KV pairs on the first denoising
                        step, so multi-reference editing (the dataset engine's whole job) runs
                        up to 2.5x faster at identical quality. A 401 still logs recovery
                        steps as a safety net (see license_url below)
  klein_lora         -> download the consistency LoRA into <ComfyUI>/models/loras/klein/

  krea_vae           -> qwen_image_vae into <ComfyUI>/models/vae/
  krea_identity_lora -> the Krea 2 Identity Edit LoRA (Civitai) into
                        <ComfyUI>/models/loras/krea/
  krea_nodes         -> prepare the pinned node pack in a supported ComfyUI portable;
                        existing unmanaged folders are preserved. Restart and a loaded-node
                        check are required before the engine can be considered ready.

No shell, no client-supplied arguments: each action's command/URL/destination is fixed.

Pip actions are SERIALIZED (one at a time, second request queued in click order): two
pip processes writing the same environment race on a shared package's dist-info and
corrupt it — proven by repro (two concurrent installs of one big binary package into
one venv fail 6/6 with WinError 2 / Errno 13). Each pip run also retries once on a
transient file-lock error (an antivirus holding a fresh file). Model downloads and the
ollama pull don't touch a venv, so they stay parallel.

# Fixed catalog of the Klein downloads (re-checked 2026-07-17): all four files are
# PUBLIC downloads. The default UNET is the KV-cache build (flux-2-klein-9b-kv-fp8):
# it caches the reference images' KV pairs on the first denoising step, so multi-
# reference editing (the dataset engine's whole job) runs up to 2.5x faster at
# identical quality — same VAE/text-encoder. Unlike the plain 9b-fp8 repo (which is
# license-gated → 401 without a token), the KV repo is NOT access-gated: HF serves it
# publicly (verified: API gated=false, resolve → public CDN). The FLUX Non-Commercial
# License still governs USE. `license_url` is kept so a future re-gating (or a stale
# token) still degrades into actionable recovery steps rather than a bare 401.

# so an install that fetched the pre-KV model never re-downloads ~10 GB (both variants

# SeedVR2 — the fidelity upscaler (issue #32, SurpassHR). Two files only, and

# pack's own guidance puts it at 8-12 GB of VRAM, which is the card most people
# have. Someone with more drops a 7B build in the same folder and points
# `seedvr2.model` at it — seedvr2_helper.resolve_seedvr2_dit picks up anything
# present, so the bigger builds need no second install action.
#
# URL survey 2026-08-02 (anonymous HTTP HEAD, no token): `numz/SeedVR2_comfyUI`
# answers 200 with the full content-length on every file, API `gated=false`,
# licence apache-2.0 — the same licence as ByteDance's own SeedVR2 weights. The
# 401/403 recovery path is kept anyway, exactly like Klein's: a measurement is a
# photograph of one moment, and a future re-gating must degrade into actionable
# steps rather than a bare error.
#
# `dest[0]` is 'SEEDVR2' — the folder the node pack itself registers under
# ComfyUI's models dir (SEEDVR2_FOLDER_NAME in its constants.py), and the same
# string seedvr2_helper.MODEL_FOLDER searches.


# 📷 Camera angles — the weights that move the CAMERA rather than the subject.
#
# WHY A SECOND BASE MODEL AT ALL, when a 9 GB one is already installed. Measured
# on this repo's own Klein lane (2026-08-25, one reference, seed held constant):
# asked for a profile or a back view, Klein turns the PERSON and leaves the room
# exactly where it was — every phrasing tried, English, an explicit "only the
# photographer moves", the Chinese cinematography terms, with and without the
# one camera LoRA that exists for Klein 9B. The backdrop delta stayed at 11-14
# (noise) against 64-80 for a real viewpoint change. The Qwen LoRA below was
# trained on 3000+ gaussian-splatting renders — pairs where the subject cannot
# move and the background must — and reaches 64-80 on all eight angles tried.
# That inversion is the feature; it is not reachable by prompting harder.
#
# URL survey 2026-08-26 (anonymous HTTP HEAD, no token): all four answer 200 and
# the signed CDN URL carries `user_id=public` — none is access-gated. The
# 401/403 recovery path is kept anyway, like every other catalog here: a
# measurement is a photograph of one moment.
#
# NOT LISTED, on purpose: the Qwen image VAE. `krea_vae` above already installs
# the identical file to the identical destination — a second key for the same
# bytes would put the same gigabyte on the Setup screen twice and let two copies
# drift. services/qwen_camera_helper.CAMERA_VAE_ACTION names that button instead.
#
# `dest[0]` is 'diffusion_models' for the model and 'loras' for the adapters,
# both under a `qwen/` subfolder — the same shape the Klein and Krea lanes use,
# and what qwen_camera_helper._scan looks for first.


# Every streamed model download, whatever engine it belongs to. The worker,

# standard subfolders, which are also the paths the repository uses - so the
# training lane's WEIGHT_FOOTPRINTS and these entries name the same four files
# and cannot drift into two different opinions of what H3 needs.
#
# `min_free_gb` is the file's own size plus room to write it, not the lane's
# total: each action is downloaded on its own, and a machine that can take three

#   * git may be absent (ZIP installs of ComfyUI have none), so a codeload ZIP
#     is the fallback — and if both fail the log says what to do by hand;

# WHY THE VIDEO STUDIO'S NODE PACKS ARE NOT HERE (maintainer's call, 2026-08-31)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "Downloading models is fine, but we do not take responsibility for breaking a
# ComfyUI install." A weight is an inert file in a models folder: worst case it
# is unused. A custom node is CODE that ComfyUI imports at startup, and one bad
# import takes the whole server down for every other lane the user has — a cost
# they did not agree to when they clicked a button in this app.
#
# So the three optional packs of the video lane (MiniMax-H3-Turbo,
# H3-Optimizations, MMH3-UltimateUpscale) and SageAttention (ComfyUI-KJNodes)
# are NAMED and LINKED by the studio, and installed by the user on the ComfyUI
# side, through ComfyUI-Manager or a clone. `video_test_studio.OPTION_NODE_PACKS`
# holds those links; nothing here fetches them.
#
# The two packs above (krea/lanpaint) predate that rule and keep their buttons —
# what changed is the direction, not a retrofit of somebody's working install.

# Node packs the app SHIPS (backend/comfy_nodes/<folder>), installed by COPY into
# the user's ComfyUI instead of fetched from a remote. See
# backend/comfy_nodes/README.md for the contract these folders sign.
#
# Why a second registry rather than a `local: True` flag on _NODE_PACKS: the two
# differ on the rule that matters most, which is what to do when the folder is
# already there. A third-party pack is LEFT ALONE (the user may have pinned a
# version of somebody else's code). Ours is OVERWRITTEN when the stamp inside it
# is not this app version — nobody pins ours, and a stale copy is how a user ends
# up running last month's sampler against this month's graph. One flag would have
# hidden an inverted rule inside a shared code path.

#                 is pinned <2 *for insightface's* ABI; opencv-python-headless is

#                 RUNS on), + the same shared numpy / headless-opencv floor.
#                 onnxruntime is listed EXPLICITLY, not via a `rembg[cpu]` extra:
#                 rembg ≥2.0.50 imports onnxruntime at module load but stopped
#                 declaring it, so a scoped masks install resolved every package
#                 it knew about, reported success, and left `import rembg` dying
#                 on ModuleNotFoundError — the capability stayed ✗ with no reason
#                 shown (issue #24, 1Tomber). The explicit name is the durable
#                 choice: the `[cpu]`/`[gpu]` extras did not exist before 2.0.50
#                 and would silently resolve to nothing on an older pin, while
